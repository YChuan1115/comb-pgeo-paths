HOW TO BUILD AND RUN
=========================================================================

* LINUX

CombinationOfPiecewiseGeodesicPaths was tested under Ubuntu 14.04

If you have libpng, libjpeg and zlib already installed in the default
library directory /usr/lib, then just build and run the project:

> make
> ./combpaths

If you wish to work with your own build of libpng, libjpeg or zlib,
you may change the include and library directories in the Makefile


* WINDOWS mingw

CombinationOfPiecewiseGeodesicPaths was tested under Windows 7 64bits
with the 32-bit MinGW version shipped with Code::Blocks 13.02

If you're using the 32-bit version of MinGW, then just run the Makefile
and it should be fine

> mingw32-make /f Makefile.mingw
> ./compaths.exe

If you're using a 64-bit version of MinGW, then you'll have to build
libjpeg, libpng and zlib on your own and set Makefile.mingw accordingly


* WINDOWS Microsoft Visual C++

CombinationOfPiecewiseGeodesicPaths was tested under Windows 7 64bits
with Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Express 32-bit

You may either create a project from scratch and add the existing source
files (select a Console Application if this is the case), or use
Makefile.msvc. Run the MSVC console and enter:

> nmake /F Makefile.msvc
> ./combpaths.exe
